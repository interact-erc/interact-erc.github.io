				<h1>Interactive Machine Learning for Compositional Models of Natural Language</h1>
				<p align="justify">
					INTERACT is a 5-year research project funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and coordinated by 
					<a href="https://ariadnaquattoni.github.io/">Ariadna Quattoni</a>. It runs from 2020 until 2025 within 
					the Computer Science Department at the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona. The goal of 
					INTERACT is to develop interactive machine learning algorithms for compositional models of natural language. 
				</p>
				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<p align="justify">
					Most Natural Language Understanding (NLU) applications have unique information needs. Large collections of 
					annotated data are necessary to achieve good performance under the supervised learning approach. In INTERACT, 
					we tackle this fundamental limitation by breaking the distinction between annotation and training and develop 
					a collaborative training paradigm. We aim to empower the learner with the ability to generate samples and ask 
					labels for any complete or partial structure in the domain. If the learning algorithm could ask the right 
					questions, minimal human annotation would be needed. To achieve this we combine an optimal human feedback 
					strategy with compositional latent-state models. We work under the framework of spectral learning of weighted 
					automata and grammars and experiment with NLU tasks of increasing complexity, from sequence and tree 
					classification to parsing problems where the outputs are trees.
